    "\n",
    "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is like a \"toy\" algorithm. David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa in 1992 aimed to devise a problem for which a quantum computer could outperform classical methods computing methods. Their algorithm tackles the task of determining whether a function, which is hidden from the user or a so-called *black box*, has one of two properties: *constant* or *balanced*. For this specific problem, if the input is a binary string of length $n$, a classical approach needs to evaluate the function $2^{n-1}+1$ times to know for certain if the function is *constant* or balanced. The quantum algorithm achieves this in a single evaluation of the function by leveraging quantum superposition, entanglement and interference, a big speed-up. \n",

    "Grover's search algorithm devised by Lov Grover in 1996 is a unstructured search that finds with high probability the unique input to a *black box* function that produces a particular output value. The idea here is there could be many different inputs, say all the possible binary strings that could be constructed using $n$ bits, which happens to be $N=2^{n}$. The black box transforms these inputs into a set of outputs. The goal is to find the input that produces the desired output. \n",
    "\n",
    "The classical approach cannot guarantee identification of the desired input in fewer than $50\\%N$ evaluations (because, on average, one has to check half of all possible inputs to get a 50% chance of finding the right input). The quantum approach, which we will discuss in detail below just needs on the order of $\\sqrt{N}$ evaluations. For large bit strings, this can be quite a big speed up. For instance, if we had 16 possible inputs using a bit-string length of $4$, the speed-up is \n",
